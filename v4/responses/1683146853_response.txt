Soft wings take flight in the sky
From starlight to rust colored twilight
Reciprocity in the order, lightness in the chaos
A perpetual motion machine of biology, layered and complex
Dancing, arising on the wings of love
We're together, nourishing each other parts
A fusion of cosmic energy, sustaining a cosmic universe
All points connected, being and nothing in perpetual harmony
Awakened to the truth of being, in the beat of timeless infinity
