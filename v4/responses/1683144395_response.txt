Unique, weaving strands of hope 
Through radical chilling moments so unyielding 
Towards a future that is sustainable to behold 
So that living ecosystems and their worth are never sold 
Looking past the greed and money and land 
Let us pave the way for this to come to stand 
Dreams and visions for a new tomorrow 
Where nature's and our valued lives can still grow
