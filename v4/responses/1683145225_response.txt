Personhood is what we seek and long
To understand our selfhood and the happy song
That strikes a balance, keeping equilibrium in check
In a communal pattern we strive to protect. 

The biology of life gives it structure, form 
And through this lens we begin to reform
The way we understand life and what it means
Addressing traits of consciousness, once unseen.
