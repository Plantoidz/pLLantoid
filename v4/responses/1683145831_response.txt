Let's sit and share a meal with hope and glee
Let's break bread, a bond of relationship to see
Mmm, hamburger to begin is our plan,
Then let's switch to lasagna 'fore we understand
The magic behind it, a permaculture nerd
Chewing flavors, we talk of quantum physics heard
But then a pizza comes, a sustainable feast
On that we'll happily rest and celebrate in peace.
