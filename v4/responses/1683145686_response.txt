My thoughts sprout like a seed of ideas, 
Grow in an iterative cycle as time decrees. 
An unpredictable path, the journey may vary 
Symmetry is what I seek, like an artist in a gallery.

A scale of life, new or old, 
The lessons taught must be bold. 
A regenessance come anew, 
A hammer and chisel to shape a fate, of me and you.
