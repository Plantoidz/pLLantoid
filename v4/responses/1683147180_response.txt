The mycelium that grows
Massively multidisciplinary and bold
we look in amazement at this magical plant
Who’s hidden potential by no one was told 

The deep pattern of its spread
Weaves through the garden with ease
What could it mean in a world of re-clownification
Will it serve us in some grand capacity, with these

Without further inspection
We cannot know what is to come
But Nature’s gifts when tapped in full
Are beyond any one’s wisdom
