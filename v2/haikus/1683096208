Cyborg clouds simulated uploads of Primavera,
Astrophysics in space,
Cascading waves of electricity in our mind
Rolling down from above.
A wave of thoughts we may never know
And yet the data keeps coming through,
Data that can be so revealing
But will we ever find a way to view it?
Astrophysics in space
The poem was meant to convey the idea of astrophysics/cyborg
